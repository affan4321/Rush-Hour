# Rush-Hour
Rush Hour is simply a game that I made in my 1st Year BSCS PF project. I used GLUT library and functions to implement it. The game has few flaws like collision with other cars is missing or you might say it's incomplete. But still, the overview and the overall implementation is there. Hope you like it!
